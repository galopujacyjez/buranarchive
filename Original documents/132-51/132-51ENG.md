On the creation of a reusable space system and advanced space complexes

The Central Committee of the CPSU and the Council of Ministers of the USSR, attaching particular importance to increasing the country's defense capability and intensifying work on creating advanced space complexes for solving military, national economic and scientific problems, RESOLVED:

1. To accept the proposals of the Ministry of General Machine Building, the USSR Ministry of Defense and the USSR Academy of Sciences:

a) on the creation of a reusable space system (MKS) consisting of a rocket booster stage, an orbital aircraft, an interorbital tug, a system control complex, a launch and landing and repair and recovery complexes and other ground-based facilities, providing for the insertion of payloads weighing up to 30 into northeastern orbits at an altitude of 200 kilometers and the return to launch and landing complex of payloads weighing up to 20 tons intended for:
- comprehensive counteraction to the activities of a potential enemy to expand the use of outer space for military purposes;
- solving target tasks in the interests of the USSR Ministry of Defense, the national economy and science;
- conducting military-applied research and experiments in space - to ensure the creation of combat space systems using weapons based on known and new physical principles;
- launching into near-earth orbits, servicing in these orbits and returning to Earth spacecraft for various purposes, delivering astronauts and cargo to orbital stations and returning them to Earth.

Set the date for the start of flight tests of the MKS as a whole - 1983.

Determine the creation of the MKS - a qualitatively new promising direction for the development and improvement of rocket, space and aviation technology - as work of special national importance;

b) on the creation of a global space command and relay system (GKKRS),
ensuring increased operational efficiency of surveillance of military and industrial facilities and the actions of a potential enemy by relaying strategic intelligence and other special information from spacecraft in real time to ground stations, as well as intended for the operational control of existing space systems.

Set the start date for flight tests of the GKKRS as 1981.

c) in development of the work envisaged by the Resolution of the Central Committee of the CPSU and the Council of Ministers of the USSR of February 9, 1970 No. 105-41, on the creation in the period 1976-1984 of three improved long-term orbital stations of the DOS-7K type to carry out an expanded range of scientific and technical research on the use of outer space in the interests of the national economy, the USSR Academy of Sciences and the further development of work on international cooperation, as well as on the creation of ships of the 7K-S type to service these stations.
