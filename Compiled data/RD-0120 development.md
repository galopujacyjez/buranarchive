RD-0120 dev

"During the initial stage of the RD0120 engine development, model tests of the components (sealing and pump rolling units), assemblies and systems (GG, KS, ignition devices, etc.) were carried out at reduced modes, simulating and real components on existing stands and experimental units of stands V1, V3, V4 of NII-HIMMASH in 1975-1980.
Autonomous development of the units and systems was mainly carried out on the stand version of the engine during fire tests sequentially at modes of 20, 50, 75 and 100% by thrust on the stand V2 of NII-HIMMASH (74 engine tests)."

Bench engines: 20, 50, 75, 100% thrust tests at stand V2
	1965-1981 - 74 tests over 13 engines, 783s total fire duration
Series engines:
	1981-1983 - 70% thrust - 164 tests over 38 engines, 12500s duration
1983-1988 - 100% thrust - 420 tests over 78 engines, 91293s duration
1988-1990 - 106% thrust - 177 tests over 40 engines, 57521s duration

"In January 1984, the installation of liquid hydrogen and oxygen systems began at the V2A stand to test the 11D122 engine at 100% thrust mode. Fire tests of the 11D122 liquid-propellant rocket engine In accordance with the program of control and technological tests (KTI), the first test of the 11D122 engine at the V2A stand"

"Before the first fire test of block "C" No. 5S, which took place in February 1986, 385 tests (100% according to RK) on 61 engines with a total operating time of 48,400 s were conducted on the V2 NIIKHIMMASH and 201 NIIMASH stands. As of March 1, 1993, 900 engine tests were conducted with a total operating time of 170,000 s, operating in 106% thrust modes.

It should be noted that the RD0120 engine bench testing was carried out with a full-size nozzle (with the exception of the bench version of the space engine for autonomous testing of the agregattas at the first stage) with a geometric expansion ratio of the nozzle fc = 98:"
