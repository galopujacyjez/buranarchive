"At the Progress plant, a special technological dimensional and refueling mock-up of the rocket was created, consisting of a central oxygen-hydrogen rocket block “C”, four side support blocks “A” and a technological block “Ya”, designed for communication with ground systems. The product was named 11K25 No4M."
